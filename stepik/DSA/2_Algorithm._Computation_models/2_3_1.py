#You have decided to write the first IT-project for further sale to Giggle company, which draws pseudo-graphic Christmas trees with NN beauty in the following way (in the example, Christmas trees with beauty from 0 to 5 are drawn):

#When this project went into production, you made an edit - the program should additionally calculate the area of a Christmas tree with beauty NN. Realize the algorithm for calculating the area of a Christmas tree with a given beauty of order O(1)O(1).

    trunk = (n * 2 + 1)
    result = trunk + branches
